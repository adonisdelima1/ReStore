# What is inside the API template? 

## Understanding launchSettings.json and making a little change on it
- launchSettings.json is taken by the system as reference when we execute ``dotnet run`` on terminal  
- Inside API project folder/directory, go to launchsettings.json and, on profile, remove the object associated with "IIS Express" key. Still in ``profiles`` section inside ``API`` object you can see the application URL.  
1. Copy the HTTP path
2. Execute ``dotnet run`` in the terminal
3. On the browser, paste that URL and add ``/swagger`` to it
4. You should be redirected to the swagger of our API. 

## What happens to the C# code when we execute.net run?
- When we execute ``dotnet run``, Program.cs is the first code block executed in our API. 
1. Go to Program.cs
2. On services injection area, remove ``app.UseHttpRedirection()`` line because this is useful only when we have production environment. 

## API.csproj, Nullable flag and Implicit Usings 
- Another important file in our API project is the API.csproj file. It tells us, for example, what version the project was created under. It says if ``Nullable`` flag is enabled or disabled in our code. When enabled every string is considered as required unless you mark them as optional (? notation. e.g.: ``string? variableName``).  
- ``ImplicitUsings`` is a reference to using statements for libraries that are globally used if you go to API > obj > Debug > net5.0 and open **API.GlobalUsings.g.cs** file to see all implicit usings that will be globally available and we don't need to mention them inside the file to use them. This makes our code smaller. 
- Iside ``ItemGroup`` there will be all the packages this project uses.  
1. Open **API.csproj** file 
2. Inside Nullable tags, be sure the value is ``disable``
3. Make sure that ``ImplicitUsings`` value is ``enable`` 

## Important to keep in mind 
- Is healthy sometimes to **exclude/remove/delete** ``obj`` and ``bin`` folders because they are generated every build/run of our project. 
- For a cleaner view of the project, we can change VS Code to show only the files that are interesting to us and hide/omit others like ``obj`` and ``bin`` folders. To make VS Code ignore this folders: 
1. Go to File > Settings... > Settings (or just press Ctrl + ,)
2. Search for "exclude" on the text field
3. In Files:**Exclude** click on **Add Pattern** and enter values for bin and obj folders
