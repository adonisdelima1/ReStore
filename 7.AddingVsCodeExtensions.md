Sometimes VS Code cannot work as we expect. To reload VS Code window:  
    1. Show all commands by pressing **Ctrl + Shift + P**  
    2. Enter "reload" in the search text box  
    3. Click on **Reload Window**  

7. After reloading VS Code window, If you see a prompt suggesting you to add some required assets to build and debug, accept clicking yes. It's supposed to create a .vscode folder that contains 2 json files (task.json and launch.json) 


Another good shortcut is when you're looking for a especific file?  
    1. Press **Ctrl + P**  
    2. **Type the name or part of it** and VS Code will suggest you some results (if it finds anything)  

Another good remind is to turn on the VS Code autosave button:  
    1.  Go to **File** then click on **Auto Save**
