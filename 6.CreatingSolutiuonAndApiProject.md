# Creating the dotnet solution and the API project 

1. Run command ``dotnet new list`` on terminal to see the range of projects you can create with the .NET SDK installed on your machine. 
2. Create a directory/folder, name it as **ReStore** and cd into it. 
3. On terminal/bash/shell, cd into the folder/directory where you want to create the project, and run the command ``dotnet new sln``. If you run ``ls`` on terminal, you'll se the recent created solution file.  
4. Run ``dotnet new webapi -o API`` (API is the name of the project). If you run ``ls``, you will see that a new folder/directory called API was created. 
5. To add API into the solution run ``dotnet sln add API``. Now you can open this solution on VS Code (doubleclicking solution's icon on MS File Explorer or in the same terminal running command ``code .`` inside ReStore folder). 
6. On VS Code's terminal, cd inside API folder/directory and run ``dotnet run``. 
7. There should appear a localhost URL where your API is listening. Copy this address, paste it on browser and press enter. If you have an error (message should be "This loacalhost page can't be found") try to add  "/swagger" to this address. Now you should see something like a fron-end for your API. That's Swagger. Swagger is just a way of documenting our API and points that we have inside our project. 
8. Test your API unique endpoint. WeatherForecast is a template that shows how an API works. This GET returns a JSON list/array of weather forecasts.
