# Setting up the development environment
We are going to build a fullstack application using .NET Core (backend) and React.js (frontend), therefore we need to install .NET Core's SDK, and also NodeJS and React. The IDE selected was VS Code and, inside VS Code, important extensions that will make our work easier: 

1. Download .NET SDK from [Microsoft's download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) and instal it. The chosen was 7.0.
2. Download and install VS Code from [VS Code's download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) if you don't have it installed yet. 
3. Node version chosen was v18.16.0. Download and install it from [NodeJS' download page](https://www.nodejs.tech/pt-br/download) if you don't have it yet. 
4. Download and install git from [Git's download page](https://git-scm.com/downloads). 
5. Run ``dotnet --info`` to see detailed info about your current installed .NET SDK and if you have any .NET SDKs installed or not. 
6. Do the same for nodejs running ``node --version`` to check if you have any versions of node js installed on your computer. 
7. Run ``npm --version`` to check the version of your node package manager.
