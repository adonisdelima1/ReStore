# What is Entity Framework? 
- Entity framework is an ORM (Object/Relational Mapper), and it set us free of writing SQL scripts. 
- The ``DbContext`` class provides us with a **gateway to our database** or provides us with **a session to our database**. It's going to be responsible for **opening** the connection and **managing** this connection to the database. 
- The ``DbContext`` can have more than one ``DbSet`` and these ``DbSet``s represent tables inside our database. A ``DbSet`` **is an equivalent to a table inside our database**. 
- To query our database we are going to use **Linq queries**. Let's assume that we want to get a list of our products. In C#/EF/Linq is: ``var products = context.Products.ToList();``. Basically we use the instance/object of ``DbContext`` to get ``Products`` (``DbSet`` instance) and list them (calling ``ToList()``). Entity Framework's job is to translate it into a SQL script, since it's an Object Relational Mapper. 
- As features provided by Entity framework we can mention:  
    - **Modelling** (it works with our objects) 
    - **Querying** (allows us to use Linq queries) 
    - **Change Tracking** (help us to control and analyse our transactions) 
    - **Saving** (EF is able to save/store changes) 
    - **Concurrency** (Avoiding simultaneous data editing, and if something goes wrong we can rollback the transaction) 
    - **Transaction Management** (it even allows us to access a list of changes that are going to our database in a single transaction) 
    - **Caching** (It can save DbSets in cache and reuse it again on a next similar transaction) 
    - **Built-in conventions** 
    - **Configurations** (we're able to configure our entities to work with entity framework and even make different things from Built-in conventions, we don't need to follow them always) 
    - **Migrations** (Based on our code (entities and other classes) Entity framework can create a set of commands to create a database in the tables based on the code that we've created)
