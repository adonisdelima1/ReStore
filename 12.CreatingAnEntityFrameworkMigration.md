# Creating an entity framework migration file
1. Inside your appsettings.development.json, if there's not any attribute called ``ConnectionStrings``, only ``Logging`` for example, create a property for connection strings and inside ``ConnectionStrings`` object value, create one property called ``DefaultConnection``. 
2. Before we continue the implementation of the connection string, we need to create the migration responsible to create the code that creates our database, so in this point we don't have a database yet 
3. Run command ``dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --version 7.0`` on terminal to install EF NuGet globally 
4. Run ``dotnet tool list -g`` to check **dotnet-ef** installation 
5. Run ``dotnet ef`` to see available options to use along this command 
6. Remember to stop your API if it's runnning, and be sure your prompt/bash/shell instance is inside API project folder 
7. Run this on terminal/bash/shell ``dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate -o Data/Migration``. We are requesting our EF NuGet to create a new migration called **InitialCreate** and the file's address/path should be inside Data/Migrations directory. If you have an error telling your EF tool/nuget package is older than the runtime, run ``dotnet tool update <PACKAGE_ID> -g`` to update it 



**REMINDER** if you want to uninstall a tool (globally): 
1. ``dotnet tool list -g`` to get the package's name and then ``dotnet tool uninstall <PACKAGE_NAME> -g`` to uninstall it.
